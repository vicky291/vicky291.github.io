        <span>Professional</span>
        <p>I’m a bioinformatician and nutrition scientist with a PhD in Nutritional Biology from UC Davis, working at the intersection of data science, biology, and health. My background focuses on applying computational and statistical methods to understand how diet influences the gut microbiome and human health. I’m deeply passionate about precision nutrition and precision health. I believe diet is a core driver of personalized health outcomes and an essential component of next-generation healthcare. This belief motivates my interest in full-stack development—building data-driven tools that transform complex biological and dietary data into practical, personalized insights for real-world impact.</p>

        <span>Personal</span>
        <p>Movement and mindfulness are central to my life. I’ve been lifting weights for over 10 years, am a certified yoga instructor, and have practiced yoga for more than a decade. In recent years, I’ve also taken up aerial pole and hoop, combining strength, flexibility, and creativity. I’m also a proud dog mom 🐾. My emotional support animal is a short-haired border collie named Charming, who keeps me active, grounded, and reminds me to step away from my laptop and enjoy the outdoors.</p>
